= cf-scale-boot

Demonstrate application instance scaling on Cloud Foundry with this simple (one Groovy file, one HTML file) Spring Boot CLI application!

== Running Locally

* Install the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli[latest Spring Boot CLI].
* Run:

----
$ spring run app.groovy
----

== Running on Cloud Foundry

----
$ cf push -m 512M -t 90 cf-scale-boot --random-route
----

We add the `-t 90` to give the app a little additional time to start up. The addition of `--random-route` ensures you won't collide with any other users of the app on public CF providers!

== SCALE!

----
$ cf scale cf-scale-boot -i 1000
----

(_or some reasonable number for your CF cloud!_)

== What you get:
